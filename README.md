# EternalRPG


A Single Player Unity and C# game.

You have a small tribe of characters.
When one dies you will need to spawn a new one from two existing characters.
They will live ABOUT ten minutes each, less if you don't feed them.
Build structures, gain skills, grow your village

Note to self in unity you set the world enviroment color under Windows-Rendering-Lighting. When you are unhappy with how it looks, adjust that.


APPARENTLY if you don't git-ignore the library folders it will become too large to easily save, so this project has fallen apart on github. Started a new repo.
